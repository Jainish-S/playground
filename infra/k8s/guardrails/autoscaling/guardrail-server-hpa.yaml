# Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for Guardrail Server
# The guardrail-server is an ORCHESTRATOR - it makes async calls to models
# and waits for responses. It doesn't do heavy compute, so scaling should
# be CONSERVATIVE and SECONDARY to model scaling.
#
# Scaling Strategy:
# - Min: 2 replicas (HA baseline)
# - Max: 10 replicas
# - Primary metric: 15 in-flight per pod (high threshold - orchestrator can handle many)
# - Secondary metric: 70% CPU (safety net)
# - Scale-up: CONSERVATIVE (120s window - wait for models to scale first)
# - Scale-down: Conservative (300s window)
